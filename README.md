## Want to keep track of your budget but have poor internet connection? :scream: :disappointed:

## Other budget trackers won't update if offline and that can mess up the whole budget! :rage: :weary:

## No problem! This budget tracker uses service workers and IndexedDB to work even when offline! :hushed: :grinning:   :heartbeat: :revolving_hearts:
